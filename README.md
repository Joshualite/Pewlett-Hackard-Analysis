# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
For this project, an analysis is carried out for a fictitious company where the biggest problem it had was that a significant number of its employees were about to retire. Therefore, through certain databases that were provided to us, we had to analyze and create new databases to be able to respond to the needs of the company, since it is necessary to know and plan the replacement of the personnel who are about to leave the company.

Therefore, two objectives are needed to know for this work:

- The first would be to know which personnel is the one who is retiring due to the title they have in the company

- The second would be to know what personnel would be available for the company's mentoring program, this so that new personnel are trained and the company does not suffer when there is this generational change

## Resorces
Sofware : Sql, PostgreSQL , PgAdmin4

## Results
The first analysis shows us the following result

- As we can see in the table, what the company could suffer the most when this staff retires would be "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff", which is understandable since the older an employee is, the older experience will have, senior positions are for people with more experience and are usually the staff who train new members, so you have to be careful when they are not in the company.

- The positions that the company will suffer the least after the retirement of its employees would be the manager position, since only two positions need to be filled. Although it is true that they are people with a lot of knowledge of the company, you can start thinking about who will replace these two vacancies in the future


The second analysis showed the following result

- This is a small sample of the database that we have, the objective was to show all the personnel that would be available to participate in the company's mentoring program, the total number of employees that could participate would be 1549

- The most important thing about both databases that were carried out is that the number of personnel that is eligible for the mentoring program is insufficient, the improvement would be to broaden the selection of participants so that in this way the company is not so affected in the future

## Summary

The situation of the company is a bit critical, since the positions that will be vacated after the retirement of its employees is a total of 90,398, and the number of employees that enter the mentoring program is only 1,549, the following table shows a bit of how the personnel that will enter the program is constituted depending on the title they have within the company

The truth is that in all positions there is very little proportion of employees that could replace the personnel that will leave the company, therefore it is urgent that the company take the appropriate decisions so that there are no deficiencies within the company in the future
